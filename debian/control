Description: copy/extract/patch apk signatures
 apksigcopier is a tool for copying APK signatures from a signed APK
 to an unsigned one (in order to verify reproducible builds).  Its
 command-line tool offers three operations:
 .
  * copy signatures directly from a signed to an unsigned APK
  * extract signatures from a signed APK to a directory
  * patch previously extracted signatures onto an unsigned APK
